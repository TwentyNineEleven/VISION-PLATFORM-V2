**Date:** 2025-11-19
**Status:** Documentation Fully Scrubbed and V2-Ready

---

## Summary

- ❌ Migration plans from Firebase
- ❌ V1 completion status ("50% complete", "already built")
- ❌ Specific cost breakdowns tied to V1
- ❌ References to existing codebase
- ❌ V1 implementation details

### 4. Content Preserved

**Kept as guidance:**
- ✅ All architecture principles and patterns
- ✅ Technology stack decisions and rationale

## How to Use This Documentation

### Starting V2 Development

1. **Read Foundation Documents**
   - [README.md](README.md) - Overview of V2 documentation
   - [general/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md](general/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md) - Product vision
   - [general/ARCHITECTURE.md](general/ARCHITECTURE.md) - Architecture patterns

2. **Review Standards**
   - [general/CODE_STANDARDS.md](general/CODE_STANDARDS.md)
   - [general/TECH_STACK.md](general/TECH_STACK.md)
   - [general/SECURITY.md](general/SECURITY.md)

3. **Plan Your Build**
   - Decide which applications to build first
   - Use platform requirements as guidance
   - Create V2-specific implementation plans

4. **Document As You Go**
   - Use [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md) for structure
   - Use [FEATURE_CREATION_PROMPT.md](FEATURE_CREATION_PROMPT.md) for features
   - Create V2-specific docs in appropriate locations

### Creating New Documentation

- Use templates provided
- Follow documentation guidelines
- Keep V2 docs separate from this guidance
- Build implementation plans specific to V2

---

## Key Principles for V2

### 1. This is NOT V1
- Don't copy V1 implementation
- Don't be constrained by V1 decisions
- Learn from V1 but build fresh

### 2. Use as Guidance, Not Gospel
- These are patterns, not requirements
- Adapt to V2 needs
- Make decisions appropriate for V2
- Document V2 decisions separately

### 3. Document V2 Distinctly
- Create new implementation docs
- Track V2-specific decisions
- Keep V2 progress separate
- Build V2 knowledge base

### 4. Build Incrementally
- Start with core platform
- Add applications as needed
- Document as you build
- Iterate and improve

---

**All criteria met! ✅**

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review key documents** to understand vision and architecture
2. **Decide V2 scope** - which apps/features to build first
3. **Create V2 implementation plan** - YOUR plan, not V1's
4. **Start building** with confidence
5. **Document as you go** using the templates provided
