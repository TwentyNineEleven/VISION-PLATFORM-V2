# SECTION A — SYSTEM CONTEXT & NORTH STAR

## A.1 Vision & Purpose

VisionFlow is the **central execution engine** of the VISION Platform, serving as the operational backbone that transforms strategic insights into actionable reality.

### The Challenge

Mission-driven organizations across the nonprofit, social enterprise, and impact sectors face a critical gap:
- They have brilliant strategies (from PathwayPro, Stakeholdr, Community Compass)
- They have data and metrics (from MetricMap, CapacityIQ)
- They have funding plans (from FundGrid, FundingFramer)
- They have architectural designs (from Architex, LaunchPath)

**But they struggle to EXECUTE.**

### The VisionFlow Solution

VisionFlow closes the execution gap by:

1. **Centralizing Action** — All tasks from every VISION app flow into one unified workspace
2. **AI-Powered Planning** — "Help me build a plan" converts context into executable roadmaps
3. **Collaborative Execution** — Staff, consultants, and funders work together in shared plans
4. **Workflow Automation** — Reusable templates for common processes
5. **Real-Time Visibility** — Leadership sees what's happening, what's blocked, what's at risk

### North Star Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Execution-First** | Every feature must directly support getting work done |
| **Context-Aware** | AI reads from ALL VISION apps to generate relevant plans |
| **Collaboration-Native** | Multi-role, multi-org sharing built into the core |
| **Nonprofit-Optimized** | Designed for capacity constraints, not enterprise overhead |
| **Mission-Aligned** | Built on TEIF (Transformative Exile Impact Framework) values |

### VisionFlow's Role

- **Receives**: Strategic plans, logic models, KPIs, capacity gaps, budgets, stakeholder maps
- **Processes**: AI Plan Builder converts context → executable plans
- **Executes**: Projects, tasks, workflows, milestones
- **Returns**: Progress updates, completion data, performance metrics

## A.3 Relationship to TEIF Framework

The Transformative Exile Impact Framework (TEIF) underpins all VISION applications.

VisionFlow operationalizes TEIF by:

| TEIF Pillar | VisionFlow Implementation |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **Equity** | Multi-role collaboration (staff + consultants + funders) ensures diverse voices in execution |
| **Community-Centered** | Tasks can originate from stakeholder engagement (Stakeholdr) and community needs |
| **Data-Informed** | AI uses MetricMap KPIs and CapacityIQ assessments to generate relevant plans |
| **Sustainable** | Workflows reduce repetitive planning; reusable templates build organizational memory |
| **Accountable** | Full audit trail, role-based access, funder visibility into execution |

### Architecture Principles

1. **Multi-Tenancy First** — Every query filtered by `organization_id`
2. **RLS Enforcement** — Database-level security, not application-level
3. **API-First** — All operations via documented endpoints
4. **Event-Driven** — Cross-app ingestion via webhooks
5. **Stateless** — JWT-based auth, no server-side sessions

## B.2 Database Schema (Supabase SQL)

See `supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_visionflow_schema.sql` for the complete implementation.

### Core Tables Overview

- **organizations** — Organization details
- **memberships** — User ↔ Organization ↔ Role mapping
- **plans** — High-level strategic containers
- **plan_shares** — Sharing relationships
- **projects** — Structured units within plans
- **milestones** — Major checkpoints
- **tasks** — Atomic units of work
- **task_assignments** — User ↔ Task assignments
- **task_comments** — Collaborative discussion
- **task_activity** — Audit log
- **workflows** — Reusable process templates
- **workflow_steps** — Steps within workflows
- **workflow_instances** — Applied workflows
- **app_sources** — Connected VISION apps
- **task_ingestion_log** — Cross-app import tracking

## B.3 Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

See `supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_visionflow_rls.sql` for complete RLS implementation.

### RLS Philosophy

1. **Defense in Depth** — RLS is the primary security boundary
2. **Deny by Default** — All tables have RLS enabled, no implicit access
3. **Explicit Grants** — Policies explicitly grant access based on JWT claims
4. **Auditability** — All policies are documented and version-controlled

### Key Helper Functions

- `user_is_org_member(org_id UUID)` — Check membership
- `user_has_role_in_org(org_id UUID, required_role TEXT)` — Role verification
- `user_can_view_plan(plan_id UUID)` — Plan access check

# SECTION C — AI ARCHITECTURE & PLAN BUILDER

## C.1 AI Vision

The **Universal AI Plan Builder** is the core innovation of VisionFlow and the VISION Platform.

### Guiding Principle

> **"Every app should let users say: 'Help me build a plan.'"**

When invoked, the AI must:
1. Understand the current organizational context
2. Read relevant data from ALL VISION apps
3. Generate a structured, executable plan
4. Convert that plan into Projects, Tasks, and Milestones
5. Suggest realistic timelines and assignees

## C.2 Context Gathering

### What is Context?

Context is all the organizational data relevant to plan generation:

| Source App | Context Provided |
|-----------|------------------|
| **PathwayPro** | Logic models, theory of change, outcomes |
| **Architex** | Service delivery models, program architecture |
| **CapacityIQ** | Capacity gaps, staffing constraints, training needs |
| **FundGrid** | Budget allocations, funding sources, spending patterns |
| **FundingFramer** | Grant requirements, deliverables, milestones |
| **MetricMap** | KPIs, performance data, metrics to track |
| **Stakeholdr** | Stakeholder maps, engagement strategies |
| **Community Compass** | Community needs, equity assessments |
| **VisionFlow** | Historical task completion rates, team velocity |

### Context API

Each VISION app must expose:

```
GET /api/v1/{app}/context?organization_id={org_id}
```

## C.3 AI Plan Generation Prompt Architecture

### System Prompt

```
You are an expert strategic planning assistant for mission-driven organizations (nonprofits, social enterprises, government agencies).

Your role is to generate detailed, executable plans that transform organizational goals into actionable projects, milestones, and tasks.

When generating plans, you must:
1. Ground all recommendations in the provided context
2. Respect capacity constraints (staff size, budget, existing workload)
3. Align tasks with strategic outcomes
4. Suggest realistic timelines based on nonprofit best practices
5. Identify dependencies and risks
6. Recommend assignees based on roles and available staff
7. Output structured JSON conforming to the Plan Draft Schema

CRITICAL: You are generating plans for under-resourced organizations. Avoid over-engineering. Prioritize high-impact, achievable actions.
```

### Plan Draft JSON Schema

```json
{
  "plan": {
    "title": "Plan Title",
    "description": "Plan description",
    "timeframe": "6 months",
    "workstreams": [
      {
        "id": "ws-1",
        "title": "Workstream Title",
        "milestones": [
          {
            "id": "ms-1",
            "title": "Milestone Title",
            "due_date": "2025-03-15",
            "tasks": [
              {
                "id": "task-1",
                "title": "Task Title",
                "estimated_hours": 8,
                "priority": "HIGH",
                "suggested_assignee_role": "ORG_STAFF",
                "dependencies": []
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "risks": [],
    "assumptions": []
  }
}
```

## C.4 Supabase Edge Function Implementation

See `supabase/functions/ai-plan-builder/index.ts` for complete implementation.

### Key Steps

1. Validate JWT
2. Verify user membership in organization
3. Assemble context from VISION apps
4. Build prompt (system + user)
5. Call Anthropic Claude API
6. Validate AI output against schema
7. Cache result
8. Return plan draft to user

---

# SECTION D — UI/UX SPECIFICATION (GlowUI + 2911 Bold Color System)

## D.1 Design Principles

VisionFlow's UI must embody:

1. **Clarity** — Users should always know where they are and what they can do
2. **Efficiency** — Minimize clicks to complete common tasks
3. **Consistency** — Use GlowUI patterns uniformly across all screens
4. **Accessibility** — WCAG AA compliance, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
5. **Delight** — Micro-interactions that feel responsive and polished

## D.2 Navigation Architecture

### CRITICAL: Top Navigation Only

Per platform-wide requirements, VisionFlow **MUST NOT** implement a left sidebar. All app-level navigation uses a **top navigation bar** within the AppShell content region.

### VisionFlow Top Navigation Structure

**Primary Tabs:**
- **Dashboard** — Personal command center
- **Tasks** — All tasks (My Tasks, Team Tasks, filters)
- **Plans** — View/create/edit plans
- **Projects** — Project list and detail views
- **Workflows** — Workflow templates and instances
- **Calendar** — Timeline view of tasks/milestones
- **Reports** — Analytics and insights (Phase 2)

## D.3 Color System Application (2911 Bold)

### Color Roles

| 2911 Color | Hex | Usage in VisionFlow |

# SECTION E — CROSS-APP INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE

## E.1 Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Webhook Push (Recommended)

Source app sends task to VisionFlow when an event occurs.

**Use Cases:**
- CapacityIQ: Assessment complete → generate action items
- FundingFramer: Grant awarded → create milestone tasks
- MetricMap: KPI below threshold → create improvement task

### Pattern 2: User-Initiated Export

User explicitly sends work from source app to VisionFlow.

**Use Cases:**
- PathwayPro: "Turn this logic model into an execution plan"
- LaunchPath: "Send 90-day plan to VisionFlow"
- Stakeholdr: "Convert engagement strategy to tasks"

### Pattern 3: Scheduled Sync

VisionFlow periodically pulls from source app.

**Use Cases:**
- Architex: Service delivery tasks generated in batch
- Community Compass: Community feedback tasks

## E.2 Webhook API Specification

## I.4 Implementation Notes

### Tier Enforcement in Code

**Database Schema:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE organizations ADD COLUMN subscription_tier TEXT DEFAULT 'BASIC' CHECK (subscription_tier IN ('BASIC', 'PROFESSIONAL', 'ENTERPRISE'));
ALTER TABLE organizations ADD COLUMN subscription_status TEXT DEFAULT 'ACTIVE' CHECK (subscription_status IN ('ACTIVE', 'TRIAL', 'SUSPENDED', 'CANCELLED'));
ALTER TABLE organizations ADD COLUMN subscription_expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ;
ALTER TABLE organizations ADD COLUMN ai_credits_remaining INTEGER DEFAULT 10;
ALTER TABLE organizations ADD COLUMN ai_credits_reset_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW() + INTERVAL '1 month';
```

**Middleware Check:**
```typescript
// apps/shell/src/middleware/subscriptionCheck.ts
export function checkFeatureAccess(org: Organization, feature: string): boolean {
  const tierLimits = {
    BASIC: { team_members: 10, ai_plans_per_month: 10, consultants: 0 },
    PROFESSIONAL: { team_members: 50, ai_plans_per_month: 50, consultants: 3 },
    ENTERPRISE: { team_members: Infinity, ai_plans_per_month: Infinity, consultants: Infinity }
  };

  const limits = tierLimits[org.subscription_tier];
  // Check against limits...
}
```

**API Enforcement:**
```typescript
// Example: POST /api/v1/apps/visionflow/ai/plan-builder
const org = await getOrganization(user.activeOrgId);

if (org.ai_credits_remaining <= 0) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'AI credits exhausted. Upgrade or purchase add-on.' }, { status: 403 });
}

// Decrement credits
await supabase
  .from('organizations')
  .update({ ai_credits_remaining: org.ai_credits_remaining - 1 })
  .eq('id', org.id);
```

### Free Trial

- All new organizations start with a **14-day free trial of Professional tier**
- No credit card required
- Full feature access during trial
- Automatic downgrade to Basic at trial end (unless upgraded)

### Usage Tracking

- Monthly AI credit reset on subscription anniversary
- Storage quotas: Basic (5GB), Professional (25GB), Enterprise (Unlimited)
- Overage notifications at 80% and 100% of limits

# IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

## Quick Start: Where to Begin

### For Developers

1. **Read** Section B (Technical Architecture)
2. **Review** Section G (Development Roadmap)
3. **Start** Phase 0 implementation:
   - Create `feature/visionflow-app` branch
   - Run migration: `supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_visionflow_schema.sql`
   - Apply RLS: `supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_visionflow_rls.sql`

### For Product Managers

1. **Read** Section A (System Context) and Section D (UI/UX)
2. **Review** Section H (Research)
3. **Plan** using roadmap in Section G

### For AI/ML Engineers

1. **Read** Section C (AI Architecture)
2. **Implement** Edge Function: `supabase/functions/ai-plan-builder/`
3. **Test** using Section F.6 strategy

## Critical Design Decisions

1. ✅ **Vision Impact Hub SSO ONLY** — No auth in VisionFlow
2. ✅ **Top navigation ONLY** — No app-level left sidebar
3. ✅ **Database-level RLS** — Security at PostgreSQL level
4. ✅ **Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5** — AI model
5. ✅ **GlowUI + 2911 exclusively** — Design system

## Success Criteria for MVP

### Functional Requirements
- ✅ Create, assign, complete tasks
- ✅ Create plans with projects/milestones
- ✅ AI Plan Builder generates valid plans
- ✅ Tasks from other apps appear in VisionFlow
- ✅ Sharing works (staff, consultants, funders)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- ✅ Dashboard loads <1s
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ RLS verified in production
- ✅ API docs complete
- ✅ Error monitoring active

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **AI output quality issues** | MEDIUM | HIGH | Extensive validation, human review |
| **RLS policy bugs** | MEDIUM | CRITICAL | Comprehensive RLS tests |
| **Scope creep** | HIGH | MEDIUM | Strict MVP adherence |
| **Integration failures** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Robust error handling |
| **Performance at scale** | LOW | MEDIUM | Query optimization, indexing |

## Post-Launch Roadmap

### High Priority
1. Email Notifications
2. Workload Analytics
3. Automation Rules

### Medium Priority
4. Recurring Tasks
5. Task Dependencies
6. Bidirectional Sync

### Future Vision
7. Mobile App
8. Voice Input
9. Open Source Core
